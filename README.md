Ansible roles
=============

A super-repository collecting of all the existing OME Ansible roles including
those released on [Galaxy](http://galaxy.ansible.com/ome/).

Update
------

The [update.py](scripts/update.py) script allows to add new Ansible roles as
submodules as well as updating existing submodules to track the `master`
branch. From the top-level repository: run

    $ python scripts/update.py
